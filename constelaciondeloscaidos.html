                                    At every moment you can tell if the vibration that you are sending is either a positive one or a negative one by identifying the feeling you are experiencing. At every moment you have a feeling and that feeling is causing you to emit or send off a vibration – and in the ‘vibrational’ world there are only two kinds of vibrations; positive or negative. So as you talk about what you don’t want and make negative declarative statements, in that moment you are sending out and emitting a negative vibration. Law of Attraction then matches it by giving you more of the same.
